Open Source Bias Detection Model:

d4data/bias-detection-model
An English sequence classification model, trained on MBAD Dataset to detect bias and fairness in sentences (news articles). This model was built on top of distilbert-base-uncased model and trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 16, a learning rate of 5e-5, and a maximum sequence length of 512.

spacytextblob performs sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library. Adding spacytextblob to a spaCy nlp pipeline creates a new extension attribute for the Doc, Span, and Token classes from spaCy.
Doc._.blob
Span._.blob
Token._.blob
The ._.blob attribute contains all of the methods and attributes that belong to the textblob.TextBlob class Some of the common methods and attributes include:
._.blob.polarity: a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0].
._.blob.subjectivity: a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.
._.blob.sentiment_assessments.assessments: a list of polarity and subjectivity scores for the assessed tokens.
See the textblob docs for the complete listing of all attributes and methods that are available in ._.blob.
